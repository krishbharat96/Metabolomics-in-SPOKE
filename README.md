# Metabolomics-in-SPOKE
Utilizes Reactome Database in the automatic creation of Metbolomic hetnets for integration into SPOKE Medical Knowledge Network. This repository also contains a module for automatically downloading resources from the reactome web api and creating the metabolomic heterogenous network on your own, local version of Neo4j. Based on the location of the starting node in the Reactome ontology, the graph gets automatically generated on Neo4j (as shown below with the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle).
